# CSS Battle Log

A record of my daily submissions to [CSS battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). I don't play to win code golf, I play to take a stab at CSS and/or broader front end development skillsets I haven't previously spent much time on.

Each file will just be an exact copy of my submission, I do not prioritize the code golf portion of the challenges, but I do try to aim for 100% accuracy. Each commit message will contain my approaches, things I've tried or didn't try, but most importantly: something new I learned that day.
