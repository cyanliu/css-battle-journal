# CSS Battle Log

A record of my daily submissions to [CSS battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). I don't play to win code golf, I play to take a stab at CSS and/or broader front end development skillsets I haven't previously spent much time on.

Each file will just be an exact copy of my submission, I do not prioritize the code golf portion of the challenges, but I do try to aim for 100% accuracy. Each commit message will contain my approaches, things I've tried or didn't try, but most importantly: something new I learned that day.

## Viewing these files

they will likely look kind of ugly if you just open the html files as is in your browser, because these were rules and properties designed for a strictly 400px x 300px viewport. Maybe one day I will make a proper viewing window/iframe but your best bet at seeing these is to either just past them into cssbattle (ideally for the day corresponding to that daily challenge) or opening them up in a browser, resizing the window to 400px x 300px (...if you even can, some browsers don't let you go that tiny :[...), and.. marvelling at the shapes and colors..? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
